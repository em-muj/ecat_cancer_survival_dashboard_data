This project outlines the data cleaning process used to prepare data for the Cancer Survival Dashboard.

It is not automated due to inconsistent data structures. Steps are outlined so that processes can easily be changed by the user.

Scripts have documentation and user instructions. Handover notes for the dashboard can be found on the SharePoint, following path "Department of Health and Social Care\NW027 - Performance Insight\ANALYSTS\Cancer\Survival and Diagnosis\Dashboard\250203 Survival Dashboard Handover.docx"
